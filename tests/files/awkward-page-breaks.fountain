INT. SOMEWHERE - DAY

Stuff happens.

So much stuff happens, that this scene takes up exactly one page.

And when we export this as a PDF with 55 "lines per page" and 61 "characters per line" (unless we protect against it) the next scene heading will end up being orphaned at the bottom of this page, with nothing below it. The contents of the next scene will appear on the following page, without any heading.
