This directory contains test cases.

There are two kinds of files in this directory:

A "source file" has the .fountain extension, e.g. 'foo.fountain'.
An "expect file" has the same base name but a different extension,
e.g. 'foo.html'.

For each source file, Screenplain is run to see if it produces
the content of the corresponding expect file(s).

E.g. for the following files:

foo.fountain, foo.html, foo.fdx

Screenplain will be run with foo.fountain as input and HTML output.
The result is compared to foo.html.
Then the same thing is done with FDX output, which is compared
to foo.fdx.
